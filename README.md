# Overview

A script for anonymizing spoken language recordings based on transcripts in the
vertikala format used by the ORAL2013 corpus.

# Dependencies

`numpy` and `scipy` might be a pain to install from source -- use Homebrew if
you need to do that :)

```sh
brew install homebrew/python/numpy [--with-python3]
brew install homebrew/python/scipy [--with-python3]
```
